# Yeethub - A platform to share your bad working code
---
Yeethub is a web platform, designed for users to upload and share questionable pieces of software, either theirs or other's. That includes:
- Spaghetti code
- Buggy/Leaky code that works
- Huge one liners
- Obscure code

## Code
---
Yeethub is designed with the client-server architecture in mind. The backend is written in python using FastAPI, while the frontend is designed in ReactJS. It's mainly a pet project of mine to practice React and FastAPI, and the interactions between a backend and a frontend system.
